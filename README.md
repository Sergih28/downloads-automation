# downloads-automation
## What it does
Moves automatically downloaded files into different folders, depending on its extension

## What I learned
- Basic stuff with Python (_function, array, class, tupple, loop, switch case_) 
- File management with Python

## Requirements
- Python 3 (_version 3.8.1 used when creating the script_)
- Watchdog package (_pip install watchdog_)
